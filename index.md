# Who am I?
I am a software engineer, and a member of the open source community. I believe software, and by extension computers, should serve a purpose, to improve the lives of those who use it, and benefit from it. I also believe it is my duty to develop my software in such a way as to enable this.

By utilising the skills I acquired during my formative years, during which time I taught myself to code, skills that were later developed formally at university, I believe it is my duty to develop the highest quality software within my capability, and the highest impact software I have access to.

# What do I do?
I am a systems developer. This means I primarily work on problems such as operating systems, compilers, network stacks, and so on. That is not to say that's all I can do - I am capable of writing web software should the need arise, and have some experience with, for example, React.js as a result.

# How to contact me
My email address is [connorwood71@gmail.com](mailto:connorwood71@gmail.com). If you wish to email me, I would ask if possible for the email to be signed and encrypted. My PGP key fingerprint is `FBD0 378C C687 F429 8863 BFBB B076 9342 0F9B 9E8C`.
